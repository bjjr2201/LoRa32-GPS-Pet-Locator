# LoRa32-GPS-Pet-Locator
Senior Project (DeVry-U 2021)

An ESP32-based project that leverages LoRaWAN technology, a subscription-free 915 kHz long-range wide area network wirelessly transmitting GPS and other sensor data up to 1 km to various LoRaWAN receiver nodes. Utilized the onboard Wifi/BT module, connecting to the ThingSpeak API for real-time GPS tracking and data visualization. Incorporated a 4G GSM module, removing the 30m limitations of WiFi enabling real-time global GPS tracking of the device.
