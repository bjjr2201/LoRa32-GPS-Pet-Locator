# LoRa32-GPS-Pet-Locator
Senior Project (DeVry-U)
Components:
  GPS = NEO7M
  Sensor = DHT22
  GSM = SIM800L
  MCU = Heltec LoRa32 V2
  API = ThingsSPeak
  
An ESP32-based project that leverages LoRaWAN technology, a subscription-free 915 kHz long=range wide area network, to wirelessly transmit GPS and other sensor data up to 1 km to various LoRaWAN nodes. Utilized the onboard Wifi/BT module, connecting to the things Speak API for real-time GPS tracking and data visualization. Incorporated a 4G GSM module, removing the limitations of WiFi, and enabling real-time global tracking of the device.
